PyCBC is a software package used to explore astrophysical sources of  gravitational waves. It contains algorithms to analyze gravitational-wave data from the LIGO / Virgo detectors, detect coalescing compact binaries, and measure the astrophysical parameters of detected sources. PyCBC was used in the first direct detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and is used in flagship analysis of LIGO and Virgo data.

PyCBC is developed collaboratively and lead by a team of LIGO scientists with the aim to build accessible tools for gravitational wave data analysis. One of the easiest ways to get a full software environment is by using one of our docker images.

 `Instructions for getting a Docker image with PyCBC <https://ligo-cbc.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/docker.html>`_.

Some interactive examples using portions of the pycbc library are also hosted in jupyter notebooks on azure. `Feel free to give them a try. <https://notebooks.azure.com/nitz/libraries/pycbc>`_
